Overview of Project

Goal is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings based on certain variables like date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO that they have claimed to see.

Results of Project
The webpage allows the user to refresh the searches of their criteria by pressing "UFO Sightings" in the top left corner, as shown below. At the bottom of this screen grab is where the user is able to input just some of the possible filters. 

Filtering by Date
The webpage allows the user to filter the UFO data by date. For example, in the image below, searching for the date 1/13/2010 will show all 3 of the UFO data gathered from that specific date in time! 


Filtering by City
The webpage allows the user to lookup cities that have experienced UFO sightings based on the data at hand. For example, in the image below, I searched for city name Benton , only show one UFO data was gathered from that city.




Filtering by State
Similarly to filtering by city, the user is able to filter data by state. In the image below, you can see that I searched”tx” in the state filter section which yielded 4 different results across State of Texas.  



Filtering by Country
The user of the webpage is also able to filter the data by country, however, there is only data from the US and Canada regarding UFO sightings. To search for these countries, the user must input "us" for the United States and "ca" for Canada. My search of the US data, which is a majority of the data, will be shown below. 


Filtering by Shape
The user will also be able to filter by the type of shape of the UFO that is present in the data. There are many different shapes in the data, and in the image below i searched for "circle" which then returned all data with the shape "circle" 



Drawbacks

Search base on the Enter date, because if we only filtering base on dates, user has to keep guessing to get some data. So we can either provider user the range of availabe dates everytime they there is no data for dates they are searching for , or just remove enter date from filter.

Recommendation 

1. Filter should not be case sensitive 
2. Type full country name instead of short form, that can get mix with some states name .
